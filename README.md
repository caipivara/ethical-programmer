# An Ethical Programmer Manifesto (in progress)

The world runs on software. Hospitals, transportation means, telecommunications, even the lives of
people depend on it.
We, as programmers, should do our jobs under some basic ethical principles because our actions, or
lack thereof, can lead to serious consequences.

- I will test my code.
- I will search and follow code convetions.

The world changes faster than software, so this document is supposed to go along and incorporate new
views and principles.
