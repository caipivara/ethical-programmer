# An Ethical Programmer Manifesto (in progress)

The world runs on software. Hospitals, transportation means, telecommunications, even the lives of
people depend on it.
We, as programmers, should do our jobs under some basic ethical principles because our actions, or
lack thereof, can lead to serious consequences.

A programmer must...

1. never create or distribute malware.

2. never write code that is obfuscated or intentionally difficult to follow.

3. never write documentation that is intentionally confusing or inaccurate.

4. never reuse copyrighted code unless the proper license is purchased or permission is obtained.

5. acknowledge (verbally and in source code comments) the work of other programmers on which the code is 	based, even if substantial changes are made.

6. never write code that is deliberately inefficient with the intent of later claiming credit for making 	efficiency improvements.

7. never intentionally introduce bugs with the intent of later claiming credit for fixing the bugs, or 		to stimulate the uptake of later versions.

8. never write code that intentionally breaks another programmer's code for the purpose of elevating 		one's status.

9. never hide known obstacles to a project's completion during any phase of development, especially the 	design phase.

10. never dishonestly downplay the difficulty of completing a project.

11. report any illegal activities of the employer.

12. never defame the profession.

13. never falsely deny the presence of bugs.

14. never reveal the secret corporate knowledge of an employer.

15. never accept compensation from multiple parties for the same work unless permission is given.

16. never perform competitive work without the employer's knowledge.

17. never conceal pertinent information from other members of the development team.

18. never conceal from the employer their financial interest in development resources.

19. never conceal any conflict of interest that may affect the project.

20. never seek external profit from a project that was funded by a second party without permission.  If 	permission is given to resell a product, the work should be discounted.

21. never maliciously injure the reputation of an employer or members of the development team.

22. never misrepresent their knowledge, experience, or abilities.

23. never take credit for another's work.

24. never steal software, especially development tools.

25. never conceal the deficiencies of other programmers by writing code for them and allowing them to 		pass it off as their own work.
26. install third-party applications without the user's permission.  Preferably not at all.

27. stay current on the advancement of the field of Computer Science.

28. never force updates on a user without their knowledge and approval.


The world changes faster than software, so this document is supposed to go along and incorporate new
views and principles.
