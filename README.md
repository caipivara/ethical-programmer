# An Ethical Programmer Manifesto (in progress)

The world runs on software. Hospitals, transportation means, telecommunications, even the lives of
people depend on it.
We, as programmers, should do our jobs under some basic ethical principles because our actions, or
lack thereof, can lead to serious consequences.

- I will test my code
- I will create code that contributes to society and human well-being
- I will not steal code maliciously
- I will not use code to evade justice 
- I will not create code that harms others
- I will not create code that is illegal in nature
- I will not create code that is deceptive
- I will not use my code to maliciously invade human privacy
- I will not turn a blind eye to malicious practices in my workspace

The world changes faster than software, so this document is supposed to go along and incorporate new
views and principles.
